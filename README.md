Road Accident Prevention System

A smart Arduino-based system designed to minimize road accidents by automating traffic lights and road safety mechanisms using servo motors, LEDs, and an Arduino Uno. This project simulates real-world traffic management and accident prevention strategies.

Features

Traffic Light System: Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs simulate real-world traffic signals.

Automatic Barrier Control: Servo motor acts as a road barrier/gate for controlling vehicle movement.

Accident Prevention Logic: Prevents collisions by synchronizing barriers with traffic signals.

Low-Cost & Scalable: Can be expanded for real-world applications such as railway crossings, school zones, or smart intersections.

Components Used

Arduino Uno

Servo Motor

Red, Yellow, Green LEDs

Breadboard & Jumper Wires

Power Supply (USB)

Working Principle

Traffic Lights:

Red → Stop

Yellow → Wait

Green → Go

Servo Barrier:

Synchronized with LEDs.

Barrier opens on Green, closes on Red.

Accident Prevention:

Ensures vehicles don’t move when the barrier is down.

Can be adapted with ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.
